NEW! on Noisetrekker2 Final (29-March-2000)

- Fixed some problems with some WAV cHunks.['LIST' cHunk] and 
  a problem with loop points data on the RIFFWAV 'smpl' cHunk.
- Csynth: Added Gain parameter.
- Vumeter goes white when you raise Clipping levels.
- CSynth: Phase Distortion used instead PW[pulse width].
  [Warmer oscillators]
- CSynth: Added volume/portamento[glide] controls.
- Cooler patternframe skin.
- Now, the WAVs loop points information are loaded and used.
  [most WAVs converted from Akai libraries has loop points info]
- CSynth: VCF -> Stabilized filters + 2 new modes BandPass&BandReject.
- Some other stuff.
- SOURCE CODE RELEASED.
- long live to NOISETREKKER.

* THANX TO ALL PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTED THIS PROJECT 
  [Amir Geva, F.Portillo, Felix Petrescu, Buzz Crew, Blaster, 
   Whitenoise, Panic, Tor Inge, Mike Edwards, Csoka Zsolt, 
   , Galaxee, Ray Lasdak, people I forgot, www.maz-sound.com,  
   etc... and all DSP junkies around this world]

[Notice I'm not wasting time from Psycle, all those features are used
 on psycle code, excepts ntk new patternframe skin of course.]

NEW! on Noisetrekker2 R12 (26 -Feb-2000)

- Final Release [Working on Psycle now]
- Bugfixes and little speeds opt.
- New patternframe skin.

NEW! on Noisetrekker2 R11 (8-Feb-2000)

- Fixed NoteCut bug command [vol row, $F'x']. [Tor Inge]
- Fixed volume bug on HighCPU mode.
- Fixed the annoying bug of the directories on the file browser.
  [i'm not sure of this, 
   it works here, please report if I'm right or not]
- Fixed CPU wasting of time when any cSynth voice was not 
  producing any sound. [HighCPU mode]

NEW! on Noisetrekker2 R10 (06-Feb-2000)

- Much Faster Playroutine.

NEW! on Noisetrekker2 R9 (05-Feb-2000)

- Upgraded from 32 to 64 Bit sampling point [offset] accuracy.
  [Much higher precission on playing samples at lower pitches]
  (32 integers bits/32 decimal bits instead 24/8 of older ntk).
- Slighty faster resampling algorithm.
- Samples length up to 65536^2 samples aka 4 Gigas [ehrr,,,, you'll never use
  this length anyway:]....
- Spline table resolution upgraded from 256 to 1024 points.
  [Smoother interpolation]
- Skinable/bitmapped pattern font, faster editing, nicer looking.
- 303 Control Tweakings are now auto-written on pattern when 
  SliderRecord switch is on [great for on-live tweaking recording
  while song is playing.
- New synthpresets, accurate playroutine and other minor bugfixes.

NEW! on Noisetrekker2 R8 (01-Feb-2000)
[Fast Release to avoid Propellerheads Legal stuff]

- Enhanced 303 emulation, better .rbs support. More resonance and
  filter envelope range.
- Fixed a little bug on playroutine that crashed ntk.
- No-longer used Rebirth 303 gfx. New one. Re-designed.
  No copyright infrightment now. =P [sorry props]
- 57 new cSynth presets by Michael Wolniak included and other some
  more by Tor Inge.

NEW! on Noisetrekker R7 (29-Jan-2000)

- 4point cubic Spline RESAMPLING!
- Fixed glide on tb303s.
- Two virtual Roland TB303, "Rebirth 338" interface, custom pattern
  engine, very closed to the real Roland TB sound.
- 303 Patterns are 'triggerable' from the tracker.
- Additional pattern commands to change 303 properties [cutoff, rez,
  tune, envmod, decay, etc...] for automatize control.
- LowPass/HighPass filter mode switch for the 303s.
- All ntk track effects can be aplied to the 303 engine.
  [Distort, Filterbank, Flanger/Chorus, Delay and Reverb]
- Propellerheads "Rebirth V2.0" .rbs files support [importing patterns].
- 303 interface [gui] can be  skinable by the user :]
- 303 engine supported in all CPU modes, [they're pretty fast =]
- Old Skool Support. ntk now recognizes and read Amiga MOD FILES:
  [Protracker, Startrekker, 4CH Mod, Soundtracker, Noisetracker]
  (But will not work with all modules.)
- Much better and rich reverb engine with filter for hi frequency 
  dampering.
- Auto-volume-fade in/Out pattern commands 
  + another new pattern commands.
- Bugfix that crashed NTK when a note is played and no instrument
  number is specified on the pattern.
- IFF2NTI by krokpitr/AGGES.

- Tb303 is a trademark from Roland.
- "Rebirth" [c]1996-1998 Propellerhead software.[Steinberg]

I dont matter if i'm violating any copyright stuff in my code...
I just tried [and sucessfully I think =] clone Roland's TB303 & RB GUI,
style, but neither Roland/Propellerheads discovered AnalogSynthesizers, 
so, if my proggy is not legal for the $$$ audio company's , FUCK THEM!

The 303-audio engine/synthesis is 100% new & coded by myself, 
	absolutely no-hackering from any program used.
 
	Just based on few documentation from the Internet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Noisetrekker r1 update 3 (20-Jan-2000)

- Loop Tempo synchronizer option on instruments [great for fine-looping]
  It plays samples like ACID. The number of lines to sync can be changed
  between 1 and 128 lines.
- Vertical [Amplitude] zoom options on sample editor.
- Wav-File exporting on sample/instrument editor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Noisetrekker r1 update 2 (18-Jan-2000)

- Added 2 player modes, "Medium" that will disable CSynth and "Lowest"
  for disable all DSP units (no fx's, dry module, as most trackers) for
  CPU saving. [Highest Quality is used on wav-rendering anyway]
- Added "3xx" pattern command for auxiliary volume finetune. Great for
  fadein/out or dance drumrolls.
- Added two new options on "sequencer" section.
- Fixed bugs and several speed-ups optimizations.
- Some new synthpresets and two example songs.
