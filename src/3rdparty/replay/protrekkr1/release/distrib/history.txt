===============================================================================
ProTrekkr releases history
===============================================================================

v1.99e:

- Test release for Linux 64 bit.
- Linear interpolation can now be selected (beside none or cubic) it's faster
  than cubic and still gives better results than none.
- Fixed a clipping bug in samples loading (for both .wav and .aif/aifc).

v1.99d:

- Added support for Audio IFF files loading.
- Auto zooming of multi-notes tracks fixed
  (tracks are now properly being reduced to fit entirely on the screen).
- Added support for German keyboard layout.
- Fixed a signal overflow which occurred with 2nd 303 unit when 1st wasn't active.

v1.99c:

- Slicer effect (4) now uses the current volume
  (from instrument's, column's or volume fx (3)).
- Better general handling of the volume column.
- Changed the behaviour of auto fading effects (17 & 18): playing a new note
  on a track which is currently auto fading won't stop the fading process
  which now have to be switched off by using either 1700 or 1800.
- Auto fading was kinda broken with multi notes tracks.

v1.99b:

- Long time running bug making text to disappear when using the 303 units
  should be (hopefully) gone now.
- Each track now have 2 columns of effects.

v1.99:

- Added maximum latency checking on OSX.
- Updated SDL library to latest for OSX and Windows.
- LCTRL+L/LCTRL+H: transpose a selected block to 1 octave lower/higher.
- LCTRL + LSHIFT + L/H: Transpose the note of a selected block
                        to 1 octave lower/higher but only for the currently
                        selected instrument.
- Added buttons for block commands.
- Commands with right mouse button functions are now shown
  with slightly different colors.
- Improved 303 editing by keeping current steps for each patterns/banks/units.

v1.98o:

- A value can now be specified with Reset Filter LFO FX (0x16).
- Randomize block command range is now 0x0 to 0xff on effects data columns.
- Fixed a bug occuring while using volumn columns and/or Set volume FX (0x3)
  with synth instruments.
- Editing was kinda broken when Step add was 0.
- Enabled latency control on Mac OSX.
- Re-enabled use of SDL threads for AROS.

v1.98n:

- Fixed a small issue with END key not jumping to proper pattern's end
  in some cases.
- Using F00 effect now stops a song.
- Fixed a crash in the replay of .ptp modules.

v1.98m:

- Modified the way envs to volumes work with null values.

v1.98l:

- Fixed a nasty bug in packing & depacking functions.
- Integrated the Amiga OS4 and AROS modifications into the repository.

v1.98k:

- Added a samples directory.
- Moved all sliders to the right side.
- Added list of available drives on Windows.
- Directories or filenames that are too long are cut on display.

v1.98j:

- Fixed another bug which would make the tracker to crash when loading a .wav
  files while another one was still playing in the same slot.
- Improved the range of the insert/backspace keys so they can operate
  on selected blocks as well as tracks or patterns lines.
- Added a function to play a .wav file without loading it by clicking
  on it's filename with the right mouse button.

v1.98i:

- Improved the .mod import.
- Fixed a bug that could confuse the interface when using speed or tempo
  commands intensively.
- Modified the pattern loop command (6) so it behave more like in the original
  protracker.
- Added the possibility to select accidental (sharps or bemols) 
  for patterns view.

v1.98h:

- Fixed a nasty bug with polyphony handling.

v1.98g:

- Fixed a bug in multi-notes handling (some notes could disappear sometimes).
- Inverted LCTRL+home/end and home/end commands.
- Fixed a bug that made the tracker to crash when an instrument was being
  loaded while a song being played (& playing that particular instrument).
- Fixed the random commands of the 303 units.
- 303 notes up & down commands were inverted.

v1.98f:

- Removed the .ptp loading function from the tracker, it's useless now as
  packed samples can be tested inside the tracker and it allowed me to slightly
  reduce the size of the replay routine.
- Instrument weren't played when the option i added in the previous version
  wasn't turned on (shame).
- Application directory was one level too low on Mac OS X.

v1.98e:

- Added a screen update scheduler so only modified parts of the screen
  are now refreshed, this should speed up things quite a bit
  as it looks like some implementations of SDL are borked.
- Added an option to play instrument while editing.

v1.98d:

- Forward looping wasn't working correctly for instruments.
- New effect: Select playing way (0x1e)
              0x1e00: Play forward.
              0x1e01: Play backward.
- Added a requester before deleting an instrument to let the user select
  what part of the instrument to discard (All, Instrument or Synth).
- Fixed the tracks disto.

v1.98c:

- Better tracks panning calculation.
- Added 3 other alternate copy blocks for patterns (Shortcuts: LCTRL+1 to 4).
- Added an option to paste blocks across patterns boundaries
  (if the blocks is too big it'll be pasted over the next pattern 
   but only if it's a different one to avoid wrapping around).
- Created a new directory (patterns) and added an option to save current pattern
  selections into it (.ppb files) (Shortcut: LCTRL+W)
  (303 patterns are also saved into that directory).
- Files are now saved into their respective directories.
- Added some visual indicators to show if copy buffers are empty or not.

v1.98b:

- Fixed a bug in the synth: ENV1 and ENV2 now really modulate the volume 
  of OSC1 or OSC2.

  **Due to this older modules don't sound exactly the same**

- There was an issue when using combined stereo instrument + synth.
- Added keys shortcut for requesters
  (Usually the first letter of the button's text)

v1.98:

- Fixed the vu meters levels.
- Reverb internal variables are now customizable
  (older presets are now provided as files).
- Added requesters before exiting or overwriting files.
- Added 8 bit (interpolated) comrpession scheme.
- Reverb wasn't initialized correctly at startup.
- Fixed a bug in .wav rendering.
- Added a better zap command.

v1.97c:

- Even more constants (Especially for modules not using instruments).
- Constants weren't generated correctly when using command 0x15.
- Implemented vibrato effect (0x1dxy) x = speed y = depth
  (can't be used if arpeggio (0x1b) is turned on).

v1.97b:

- Modified the behaviour of the ring mod stereo filter.
- Added a few more constants for the replay.
- Song name wasn't displayed in the plugin infos.
- Fixed a bug in the flanger (early cut).
- Right mouse button on the "Lock / All" button to locked/unlock
  all instruments at once.

v1.97:

- More granularity in constants generation (potentially smaller replay).
- Mp3 samples packing bitrate is now selectable between:
  64, 88, 96, 128, 160 & 192 kbps.
- LSHIFT+I: Show instruments list / LSHIFT+S: Show synths list.
- Forgot to include LameACM.inf in the windows distribution
  (without that file the codec couldn't be installed
   and samples using mp3 packing scheme weren't packed at all, shame).
- Added At3 samples packing scheme (Windows users need to install
  the atrac3 codec located in the install directory in order to pack samples).
  Rates are: 66, 105 & 132 kbps (depacker not yet implemented on PSP, tho).
- Added the ability to select a range of positions for songs rendering to .wav.
- The nasty click occuring when loading a module while another one
  was still playing should be gone.
- Added mouse wheel navigation support in samples editor.
- Cubic interpolation can now be disabled
  (should increase speed a bit but at the expense of lower quality).
- Added ADPCM packing scheme.
- Added an option to pack & lock instruments and use them directly
  in the tracker. (unpacked versions of the instruments are kept safe
  and are saved in .ptk files as usual).
  These instruments can't be modified in the samples editor.
  This should come in handy to finetune a module prior to a .ptp export.
- Fixed a bug with TrueSpeech packed samples.

v1.95:

- Introduced small tracks
  (right click on the 3rd icon of a track or globally via the sequencer).
- Added 3 commands in the sequencer to zoom all tracks at once.
- Filesizes are now displayed beside names.
- Added an instruments remapper in the sequencer tab.

v1.94b:

- Added some colors for the notes
  (also changed the font so patterns should be a bit easier to read now).
- Added volume ramping for the 303 units.
- The 2nd 303 unit wasn't triggered correctly.

v1.94:

- Fixed a nasty memory leak in the PSP replay
  (also only necessary data are now allocated).
- Space char wasn't available during names input.
- Added effects 0x41 and 0x42 to control the volumes of the 2 303 units.
- Added effect 0x1c: set global volume.
- Start & stop song cleaned up (clicks should be gone or at least reduced).
- Fixed a small issue regarding latency in the Mac OS X version.

v1.93:

- Resampler improved, should produce much less aliasing.
- Fixed a small issue involving the cache memory in the PSP replay.

v1.92b:

- Added an option to show or hide the bottom panel in order to display
  more patterns rows (Shortcut: LSHIFT+ESCAPE to toggle the view)
- Left shift wasn't active while editing data columns
  of patterns to enter digits.

v1.92:

- Added global lists for instruments and synths,
  that should improve the ergonomy a bit.
- Samples weren't re-initiliazed correctly after a "New Module" command
  was issued.
- Fixed a bug in the 2nd oscillator of the synth core
  when using custom waveforms.

v1.91b:

- Fixed the rand commands in the synth tab.

v1.91:

- Midi controller modification command (0x90) wasn't accessible anymore
  in panning row, fixed.
- Fixed an issue that could occur with rand() function under linux.
- Introduced zoomed tracks; Each track can be zoomed independantly
  and will be displayed with a bigger font.
- Track volume wasn't correctly re-initialized when only instrument column
  was filled without any note.

v1.90e:

- Midi notes off command was broken.
- Effect 0xAxx (Set Random Cutoff) slightly modified, the xx value is now
  the amplitude of the calculated random value from 0 to 0xff.

v1.90d:

- Implemented midi in/out for Linux and Mac OS X.

v1.90c:

- Fixed a bug in the recording mode.
- Recording now starts at the current pattern line instead of restarting
  from it's beginning.

v1.90b:

- An extra note was pasted after names input when editing mode was turned on.

v1.90:

- Added a scrollbar beside patterns.
- The tracker can now load all these .wav file formats (mono or stereo) :
  - 8-bit integer.
  - 12-bit integer.
  - 16-bit integer.
  - 24-bit integer.
  - 32-bit integer.
  - 32-bit float.
  - 64-bit float.
- Added an option to render a module as 32 bit (float) .wav file.
- Inverted the right and left mouse buttons functions in patterns.
- Fixed an issue with the loop editor.
- Patterns now automatically scroll when using the right mouse button
  (also work when selecting a block).
- Added multi notes channels, they can be used to trigger several notes / track
  at the same time in order to make chords or to play several instruments
  in the same track and route them to the same row effect / dsp effect
  (thus allowing to considerably reduce the dsp usage and also introduce some
   modularity which could be useful, especially for the PSP replay).
  Note that these channels are shared with the polyphony ones.
- Improved volume ramping.
- Keys repeat was disabled when editing note columns.
- Added LCTRL+TAB and LCTRL+LSHIFT+TAB to cycle through the notes of a track.
- Added LALT+A and LALT+LSHIFT+A
  to select one or all notes/instruments columns of a track.
- Modified the record function (for a better one, i hope).
- Some edition commands weren't working on last track.
- Midi channels polyphony implemented.
- Improved Mac OS X keyboard handling a bit.
- Compressor wasn't set right when loading .ptp files.

v1.86b:

- Fixed a bug with the 303 data loading in the replay routine.
- Fx 0A (Set random cutoff) was disabled due to a typo in the fx constants.
- Added the first version of a replay routine for the PSP,
  
  It uses the 2nd processor so the main CPU time occupation is really minimal.
  
  Keep in mind that this is an experiment and that this console isn't a PC
  so you'd better go very easy on the dsp effects and channels polyphony,
  especially the flanger is a really heavy toll because the media engine
  doesn't have any integrated hardware sin/cos or pow instructions.

  Samples depacking with the PSP codecs isn't implemented yet
  (so samples packing should be set to "none" in that case).

v1.86:

- Fixed a bug with channels that could be heard faintly even when being muted
  (was also present in wav rendering).
- Channels polyphony (up to 16) implemented.
  Value for a module can be changed in FX Setup tab.
- Switching to FX Setup tab produced a small sound glitch
  due to a re-generation of the reverb buffers.
- Added C-masters.ptk by Rhino.
- Keyboard polyphony improved (notes don't "spread" on other tracks).
- Removed some clicks due to channels filters.
- Fixed a bug in .ptk depacking process which could lead to a crash.

v1.85c:

- Removed the Audio unit code from the Mac OS X port and went to device level,
  the result should be is faster.

- Compressor wasn't triggered in the stand alone replay.

v1.85:

- First PARTIAL and EXPERIMENTAL test port for Mac OSX (ppc & x86)
  (no midi and no samples compression).
- Fixed a bug in the replay which would sometimes lead to a crash
  if an instrument number was used without a note.
- Renamed .psy file to .psm.
- The tracker is now using a custom mouse pointer.
- Forgot to mention it but the manual is now only available at this url:
  http://code.google.com/p/protrekkr/wiki/introduction

v1.84b:

- Added dream weaver.ptk from Rhino.
- Fixed a bug which occured when loading presets files,
  portamento glide was turned to 50% if it was off.

  (fr & en keyboards definitions are provided in skins directory,
   see manual.txt to know about the procedure to add new definitions).
- Winamp/XmPlay plugin source code included within the source code package.

v1.83g:

- Fixed a bug in the reverb initialization.

  *may* have been solved.

v1.83c:

- Added Arpeggio effect (1B):
  It's behaviour is a bit different than from other trackers, example:
  
  C-7 00 .. .. 1B37 <- Turn it on
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 1B38 <- Change datas
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 1B00 <- Turn it off
  
  (Note that effects 01, 02 & 05 are ineffective when 1B is turned on).

- New fx: 0x7 (FX Synchro):
  a .psy file containing synchro informations is now created
  whenever a .ptp module is saved (if the effect 7 isn't used in a module
  such file won't be created at all).
  Check manual.txt for .psy files structure.

  due to this the tracker sounds different again (for the best, i hope).
- Phase distortion is now a pulse phase.
- I didn't mention it before but LCTRL + S shortcut
  can be used to save modules.
- The C of the synth waveforms was a F & everything was shifted of 5 semitones
  and that bug was present since ntk1/2/3 !
  (Thanks to kaneel for notifying me about that one)
- LCTRL + LSHIFT + D/U: Transpose the note of a selected block
                        to 1 seminote lower/higher but only for the currently

- Minimal .mod files imports (up to 16 channels) don't expect miracles.

v1.4d (First public release):

- Ptk_SetPosition() available in the replay routine.
- Fixed a small issue with window focus at startup.
- BPM and ticks/beat are now displayed in decimal.
- Implemented MP3 packing scheme for samples.
- Fixed a bug with compressed modules.

v1.4b:

- Synth instruments inside modules weren't loaded properly sometimes.
- Instruments are now correctly deleted.
- Fixed a bug regarding very small samples in packed modules.
- Removed some clicks.
- ADSRs volumes are now calculated a bit differently
  (and setting Lfox->Oscx Volume to 0 will now disable the volume oscillation).
- Added a visual command to switch fullscreen mode on/off.
- Added a centering button command ("C") for synth parameters.

- Shift+Insert/Backspace: Insert or Delete an empty line in current pattern.

v1.0e:

- Added the ability to load & save 303 patterns.
- Renamed to NoiseTrekker 64 (i'm still indecisive about the name :]).
- Fixed a bug in the 303 patterns handling.

v1.0d:

- ADSR for looping samples are calculated a bit differently
  (proportional to the length of the loop but independant of the note)
  that should help creating short custom synthetic like samples.

v1.0c:

- Fixed a bug in ADSR release for waveforms.

v1.0b:

- Fixed a small bug with channels on/off status in the replay.
- Fixed a bug when using the mouse wheel on the sequencer.

v1.0:

- Fixed blocks randomize command.
- Single columns can now be selected instead of whole tracks.
- LCTRL+D/LCTRL+U: transpose a selected block to 1 semitone lower/higher.
- LCTRL+A: Select entire current track.
- LCTRL+LSHIFT+A: Select entire current pattern.
- Home: jump to start of row.
- LCTRL+Home: jump to top left of pattern.
- End: jump to end of row.
- LCTRL+End: jump to bottom right of pattern.
- Right Alt: play current pattern.
- Pattern highlighting can now be turned off.
- Added a startup logo.
- Shift+Arrows/Page up/down: select block.

Beta b:

- Fixed a bug with the lengths of the waveforms ADSR handling.
- Setting a loop of length 0 in the sample ed. will just disable
  the looping mode for that instrument
  (and avoid the tracker to crash when trying to replay it).

Beta a:

- Mousewheel can be operated during patterns blocks selections.
- Tracks properties are now refreshed during playback.
- Instruments finetune slider doesn't wrap around anymore.
- Renamed from SoundTrekker to SynthTrekker.
- Added the ability to use waveforms instruments in the synth.
- Fixed a small bug in keyboard handling.
- Better handling of the instruments played with the keyboard (no repeat).

Release z:

- Added patterns highlight lines customization.
- C & V keys notes were inverted.
- Removed lfo periods multipliers.

Release y:

- User can now use the mouse wheel to scroll when the pointer
  is over patterns sequence.
- Fixed a 303s outrageous signal clipping issue.

Release x:

- Fixed a bug with sliders handling.
- Increased the size of 303's buttons clickable arrays.

Release w:

- Improved patterns blocks selection (reversed selections are now handled).
- Added mouse support for blocks selection (using right mouse button).
- Fixed a bug with LCTRL+letters key strokes.
- LCTRL+R & LCTRL+I now work on all selected tracks.

Release v:

- Added cut/paste options and notes up/down in 303s interface.
- Fixed some bugs in sequences handling interface.
- Added mouse wheel steps multiplier option.

Release u:

- Added a horizontal scrollbar for patterns.
- Easier button to switch the 303s waveforms.
- Added shift + left/right arrows for next/prev. position.
- Keyboard handling should be fixed.
- User can now select sound latency.

Release p:

- Can now set caret position in patterns with the mouse.
- Can use Mouse wheel to scroll files list and patterns.
- More flexible delay ticks synchro.
- Fixed a bug in synth parameters handling.
