This is Audacious (http://audacious-media-player.org/) input plugin for UADE (http://zakalwe.fi/uade/).

* Features:
- Subsongs, song length, format name lookup from UADE
- Author name lookup from Modland

* Requirements:
- Audacious >= 3.8
- UADE >= 3.0

* To build:
autoreconf -ivf
./configure && make

* To install:
sudo make install

* Configuration:
- Configure the path to conf/allmods_md5_amiga.txt in the plugin settings to enable author name lookup
- Use the included eagleplayer.conf and song.conf configs in conf directory for improved compatibility with Modland

* Known issues:
- On OSX, the plugin has a wrong suffix, either rename it to uade.bundle or make a symlink uade.bundle -> uade.so

* Other notes:
- Currently only tested on OSX, but should work on Linux as well.
- My custom string for song display:
${?codec:[${codec}]}  -  ${?artist:${artist}  -  }${?album:${album}  -  }${title}  ${?copyright:-  (${copyright})} ${?year:- (${year})} ${?subsong-id:${?subsong-num:-  [${subsong-id}/${subsong-num}]}}
