This is Audacious (https://audacious-media-player.org/) input plugin for UADE (https://zakalwe.fi/uade/).

Main features:
- Song length and author database (see below)
- Player independent songend detection (similar to "deep songend scan" option in DeliPlayer for Windows)
- Preferences UI for configuring UADE playback options etc.
- Custom fork of UADE including support for additional formats not (yet) supported in official UADE releases:
-- Face The Music
-- OctaMED Soundstudio / MMD3
-- Protracker4 / Protracker IFF
- MED4 sng+samples format support via MED4->MMD0 conversion
- DigiBooster 3 and DigiBooster Pro 2 (http://www.digibooster.de/) support using the official portable replay
- HivelyTracker (http://www.hivelytracker.co.uk/) support using the official portable replay

Modland (http://ftp.modland.com/), AMP (https://amp.dascene.net/) and UnExotica (https://www.exotica.org.uk/wiki/UnExoticA) are used as sources for precalculated song lengths and author/album meta data.
In addition Mods Anthology (https://archive.org/details/cdrom-amiga-mods-anthology-1), Wanted Team (http://wt.exotica.org.uk/), Zakalwe (git://zakalwe.fi/chip) and Aminet (https://aminet.net/) are used as sources for precalculated song lengths.
