This is Audacious (https://audacious-media-player.org/) input plugin for UADE (https://zakalwe.fi/uade/).

Modland (http://ftp.modland.com/), AMP (https://amp.dascene.net/) and UnExotica (https://www.exotica.org.uk/wiki/UnExoticA) are used as sources for precalculated song lengths and author/album meta data.

In addition Mods Anthology (https://archive.org/details/cdrom-amiga-mods-anthology-1), Wanted Team (http://wt.exotica.org.uk/), Zakalwe (git://zakalwe.fi/chip) and Aminet (https://aminet.net/) are used as sources for precalculated song lengths.
