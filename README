This is Audacious (http://audacious-media-player.org/) input plugin for UADE (http://zakalwe.fi/uade/).

* Requirements:
- Audacious >= 3.8
- UADE >= 3.0

* To build:
autoreconf -ivf
./configure && make

* To install:
(sudo) make install

* To install author and songlength dbs:
mkdir -p "${HOME}/.uade" && cp -i conf/* "${HOME}/.uade/"

* Known issues:
- On OSX, the plugin has a wrong suffix, either rename it to uade.bundle or make a symlink uade.bundle -> uade.so after first install

* Other notes:
- Currently only tested on OSX, but should work on Linux as well.
- My custom playlist entry template:
${?codec:[${codec}]}  -  ${?artist:${artist}  -  }${?album:${album}  -  }${title}  ${?copyright:-  (${copyright})} ${?year:- (${year})} ${?subsong-id:${?subsong-num:-  [${subsong-id}/${subsong-num}]}}
