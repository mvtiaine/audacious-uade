This is Audacious (https://audacious-media-player.org/) input plugin for UADE (https://zakalwe.fi/uade/) and other retro music replays.

* IMPORTANT!
- Make sure "Probe content of files with no recognized file name extension" setting is *enabled* and "Guess missing metadata from filepath" setting is *disabled* in Audacious prefs in order for subsongs and meta data to work properly. The playlist must also have been created *after* the settings are applied.

Main features:
- Precalculated database for song lengths and author/album/publisher/year meta data (see below)
- Player independent songend detection (similar to "deep songend scan" option in DeliPlayer for Windows)
- Preferences UI for configuring UADE playback options etc.
- Custom fork of UADE (https://gitlab.com/mvtiaine/uade) including support for additional formats and platforms not (yet) supported in official UADE releases:
-- Face The Music
-- OctaMED Soundstudio / MMD3
-- Protracker4 / Protracker IFF
-- Support for AmigaOS (and related), Windows (MSYS2/MinGW), ...
- MED4 sng+samples format support via MED4->MMD0 conversion
- DigiBooster 3 and DigiBooster Pro 2 support (http://www.digibooster.de/)
- HivelyTracker support (http://www.hivelytracker.co.uk/)
- Fasttracker 1 & 2 support (https://github.com/8bitbubsy/ft2play)
- Scream Tracker 2 support (https://pastebin.com/ifXSCZ71)
- Scream Tracker 3 suppor (https://pastebin.com/AwRXZAw7)
- Impulse Tracker 1 & 2 support (https://github.com/8bitbubsy/it2play)
- ProTrekkr 1 & 2 support (https://github.com/hitchhikr/protrekkr)
-- note: older ProTrekkr mods may play incorrectly
- NoiseTrekker 2 support based on sources from the final release
- libopenmpt support (https://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/)
- libxmp support (https://xmp.sourceforge.net/)

Modland (http://ftp.modland.com/), AMP (https://amp.dascene.net/), UnExotica (https://www.exotica.org.uk/wiki/UnExoticA) and Demozoo (https://demozoo.org/) are used as sources for precalculated song lengths and author/album/publisher/year meta data (if available).
In addition Mods Anthology (https://archive.org/details/cdrom-amiga-mods-anthology-1), Wanted Team (http://wt.exotica.org.uk/), Zakalwe (git://zakalwe.fi/chip) and Aminet (https://aminet.net/) are used as sources for precalculated song lengths.
